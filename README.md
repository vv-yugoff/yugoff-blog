## Resume website

This site conveys everything that is expressed in the resume created on hh.ru . 

It's just another way to uniquely present the knowledge and skills that I improve every day.

This site was initially written purely in html, css and js, then added jquery, the next step was to move the site to django to start understanding web frameworks, as well as databases. After migrating to django, I decided to put it on hosting, but found a free solution in the form: PythonAnywhere is a cloud platform for deploying and hosting web applications in Python.
Next, me should update my portfolio with my projects :)
